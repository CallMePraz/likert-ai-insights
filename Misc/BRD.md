# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop an internal dashboard for survey analysis. The dashboard will allow engineers to efficiently analyze and visualize survey results, including Likert-scale responses and geographic data (e.g., Indonesian provinces).

## 2. Stakeholders
- **Internal Engineers**: Primary users who will use the dashboard for data analysis and reporting.
- **Project Managers**: Oversee the development and ensure requirements are met.

## 3. Business Goals
- Enable engineers to quickly analyze survey data with interactive visualizations.
- Support decision-making with clear, actionable insights from survey results.
- Improve efficiency in handling, filtering, and aggregating survey responses.

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Upload and process survey data (including Likert-scale responses).
- Display summary statistics (averages, distributions) for survey questions.
- Visualize data geographically (e.g., by Indonesian province).
- Filter and segment data by various criteria (province, question, etc.).
- Export analysis results (e.g., CSV, PNG).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Internal use only; no public access.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Fast data processing for datasets up to 10,000 responses.
- Secure handling of potentially sensitive internal data.

## 6. User Stories
- As an engineer, I want to upload survey data so that I can analyze responses.
- As an engineer, I want to view average scores by province so that I can identify regional trends.
- As an engineer, I want to filter results by question so that I can focus on specific topics.
- As an engineer, I want to export charts and tables so that I can include them in reports.

## 7. Success Metrics
- Dashboard is adopted and regularly used by internal engineers.
- Survey analysis tasks are completed at least 50% faster compared to manual methods.
- Positive feedback from users on usability and speed.
